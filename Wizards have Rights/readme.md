Automation for those wizard subclasses that didn't get enough love for automation! You will need to have your Discord account linked up with D&D Beyond, and own the appropriate content to access this.

**Currently Supported Subclasses:**
Abjuration
Enchantment
Evocation â€” For Potent Cantrip it is recommended to create a new tome with the cantrips instead!
War
Necromancy

If there are any issues please ping me on the Official Avrae server.

Please enjoy! And always have fun!

*More subclasses will be added over time, except for those already on the workshop*
