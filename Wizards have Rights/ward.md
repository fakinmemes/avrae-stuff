This alias helps to you! You the Abjuration Wizard, to manage your Arcane Ward for you, preventing damage on both you and your teammates, making for easier tracking in combat! 

You need to have a Counter called `Arcane Ward` for the alias to work. To do this, you can run the `!level` alias by Derixylth#0636 or create the counter yourself using this command `!cc "Arcane Ward" -max 1 -type bubble -reset long`

`!ward` brings up the help menu.

**__Valid Arguments__**
`-d #` is the main feature of the ward, and will replenish your lost HP (and temp HP), as well as consume the HP of the Arcane Ward, all in one! If you use it with `-t <target>` you can use the Projected Ward feature instead (Needs Wizard level 6).
`-l #` replenishes the Arcane Ward based on the level of the slot used, and shows you how many slots you have left.
